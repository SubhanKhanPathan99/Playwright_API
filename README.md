****Project Description**
This project is an end-to-end API Automation Framework built using Playwright Test Runner. 
The automation suite covers the complete lifecycle of RESTful API operations including POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE on the public Restful Booker API. 
The framework dynamically generates test data using Faker.js and handles time-based values using Luxon. 
Reports are generated using the native Playwright HTML Reporter as well as Allure Reporting for detailed execution insights.

The core test flow includes:

Creating a new booking (POST)

Validating booking details (GET)

Authenticating and generating token for secure operations

Updating data using PUT and PATCH

Deleting the booking record

Assertions for response codes, payload validations, timestamps, and business logic.

The Playwright configuration is designed for scalability. It supports parallel execution, retries on CI, and runs tests across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. Additional reporters like JUnit XML are included for CI integrations.

**CI/CD Integration**
This project is fully integrated with CircleCI and AWS CodeBuild for automated test execution. Whenever code is pushed to the repository, the CircleCI pipeline installs dependencies, runs the Playwright test suite inside a Playwright-supported Linux container, generates reports, and then pushes the HTML test report to an AWS S3 bucket for centralized access.

AWS CodeBuild provides an additional CI layer that can be triggered from AWS. It executes the test suite, builds the HTML Playwright report, and stores the results as artifacts. S3 can be configured to serve the reports through a public link or behind IAM permissions.

Overall, this framework demonstrates API testing, CI/CD automation, report generation, cloud artifact storage, reusable configuration, and scalable test execution patterns.

A robust API automation framework built with **Playwright**, designed to test the [Restful Booker](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com) API. This project demonstrates End-to-End (E2E) API testing capabilities including CRUD operations, dynamic data generation, and advanced reporting.

## 🚀 Features

* **Framework:** [Playwright Test](https://playwright.dev/) for API automation.
* **Dynamic Data:** Uses [@faker-js/faker](https://fakerjs.dev/) to generate random user data for testing.
* **Date Handling:** Uses [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/) for precise date formatting and calculations.
* **CRUD Operations:** Covers POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE HTTP methods.
* **Authentication:** Handles token generation and cookie-based authentication for protected endpoints.
* **Reporting:** Integrated with **Allure Report**, **JUnit**, and Playwright's default **HTML Reporter**.
* **CI/CD Ready:** Configured for parallel execution and CI environments.
